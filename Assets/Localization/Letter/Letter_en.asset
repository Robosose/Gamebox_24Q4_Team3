      Nothing will ever be the same.

      My
      wife... My beloved Lisa has gone mad. I saw it, but I didn''t want to believe
      it. No... I didn''t want to see.

      It got to the point where Lisa killed
      our daughter. And what could I do? I could only swallow tears as I removed
      the bloody splinter from our baby girl''s tiny body. A baby so loved and so
      wanted.

      I screwed up. All I have left in my life is a lie. Everyone
      thinks Lisa took the baby and ran away, but no. I buried the baby myself in
      the backyard, but Lisa-- Lisa''s locked in the basement and she hates me. She
      thinks I''m a monster. Does she remember anything? Does she understand? I don''t
      know.

      I''m so guilty, but I can only confess to a miserable piece of
      paper. It''s the least I can do.

      Now we''ll go away.

      I''ll
      keep quiet, keep this terrible secret, because it''s all my fault.'
